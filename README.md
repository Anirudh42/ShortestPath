# ShortestPath
Shortest Path between two given vertices, using BFS algorithm.

Implmented using C++

Input:

V 15  \\Specification of number of Vertices in Graph

E {<2,6>,<2,8>,<2,5>,<6,5>,<5,8>,<6,10>,<10,8>}. \\Specification of Edges in Graph 

s 2 10. \\To find shortest path between Vertex Number '2' and Vertex Number '10'

Output:

2-8-10 \\ One of the many shortest paths(2-6-10 is also a shortest path)
